# Giphytastic
Developed with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.  This fun little app, powered by the Giphy API, allows users to search for and view images.

In the text box, type in a subject (eg. cats, babies, dolls ... ) and be amazed with the cool pictures!  Click on the image to see it in motion.  Adjust the slider to see more or less results per search.

Thank you and I hope you enjoyed this project!
